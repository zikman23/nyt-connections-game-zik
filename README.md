This is a pared down version of the New York Times game Connections. It includes the core functionality of the game, without some extras like animations. This was done as a 24 hour test, and completed using React, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
